(No late submission allowed) 
How to submit? : Submit your source code and sample result with report of 
findings 
Implement two sorting algorithm (insertion and merge sort) learned in the class with several 
inputs from different size. 
Compare the running time from implementations and write a report of your findings. 
Start with small size input like 10 integer arra
y and increase your input size until your computer 
can handle or meaningful results occurs. 
Use exact algorithm from text book for sorting programming and you can use system clock to 
measure running time.
